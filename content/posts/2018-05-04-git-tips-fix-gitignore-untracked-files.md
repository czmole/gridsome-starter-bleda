Letâ€™s say youâ€™ve added by mistake a folder to your repo, you want to remove it from tracking and, of course, you are adding it to your .gitignore file.

Butâ€¦. pff, git continues to track itâ€¦ ðŸ˜Ÿ

Here are a few lines to run to start fresh and have all git-ignored files untracked for sure:

** IMPORTANT NOTE : First commit your current changes, or you will lose them. **

```bash
git rm -r --cached .

git add .

git commit -m "fixed untracked files"
```
