Got to this piece of info when checking on this [dev.to article](https://dev.to/lpellis/things-you-may-not-know-about-chrome-devtools-53k6?utm_source=Pointer&utm_campaign=9f4c635030-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_ISSUE_155&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6ba2b83261-9f4c635030-590000805) which covers 10 such tricks about the dev tool in the browser.

I noticed the last one which says that by using CTRL + click in the code inspector, styling pane, hitting that on the CSS rule definition you can jump to the place where that CSS property is defined. 

I didn't know this and found it useful.

Now I am still looking for similar functionality in Firefox :-)
