    <h3 id="side-projects">Side Projects</h3>
    <p>One of my side projects, is&nbsp;<a href="https://confdesk.com/">confdesk.com</a>&nbsp;- a web application that aims to help people running call for papers, call for speakers for conferences, symposiums, sending invites, running peer reviews with their editor/reviewers, payments, reports, badges, etc - the current aim is to have a beta version by March 2018. The app is running a first version which is very old (10 years old code base and design) but the new version is meant to run as a subscription-based service/software.</p>
    <h3 id="volunteering">Volunteering</h3>
    <p>Starting 2017 I started to volunteer with the great team from&nbsp;<a href="https://code4.ro/en/who-we-are/">Code4Romania</a>&nbsp; helping in various projects they have. Check on their projects to see how the help Romania develop and please consider a donation if you want to help these moving on <a href="https://code4.ro/en/donate/" target="_blank">https://code4.ro/en/donate/</p> üöÄüî•‚ù§‚ö° They are really doing a great great job!</p>
    <h3 id="freelancing">Freelancing</h3>
    <p>As time permits I also do freelancing on small/medium size projects - preferably backend/server-side tasks.</p>
    <h3 id="this-blog">This blog</h3>
    <p>During the past 10-12 years, I have started several blogs, at the very early stage of blogging in Romania, dropped in several times because writing is not really me. But, the aim of my posts here is to share my findings, from my work, sharing solutions that I have found for problems that I got into. Many might be outdated but new to me but that way practicing writing helps improving it and helps me find the solution to a problem easier next time.</p>
    <h3 id="get-in-touch">Get in touch</h3>
    <p>You can find more about my findings, stuff that gets me busy and you can also send me direct messages via twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/czmole">@czmole</a></p>
